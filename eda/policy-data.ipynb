      "Introduction\n",
      "The Blue Planet Fund is the UK’s £500 million programme supporting developing countries to protect the marine environment and reduce poverty.\n",
      "Approximately 3 billion people rely on the ocean for their food security and livelihoods, with those in developing countries particularly dependent on the ocean. The ocean economy is expected to grow faster than the global economy as a whole over the next decade, presenting opportunities for developing countries to grow their economies sustainably and improve the livelihoods of their people. At the same time, the ocean is facing serious and increasing threats from over-exploitation, pollution, biodiversity loss and climate change.\n",
      "Financed from the Official Development Assistance (ODA) budget, the Blue Planet Fund is an important part of the UK’s global leadership on marine issues. This includes our call to protect at least 30% of the global ocean by 2030 (for more information look at the Global Ocean Alliance ‘30by30’ initiative) and our existing commitments to stop plastic pollution entering the ocean through our joint UK and Vanuatu-led Commonwealth Clean Ocean Alliance.\n",
      "The Blue Planet Fund supports the delivery of the Integrated Review, which puts tackling climate change and the loss of biodiversity at the heart of the UK government’s international priorities. The fund also contributes to the UK’s commitment to increase its international climate finance support to at least £11.6 billion over the next 5 years. At least £3 billion of this will be invested in climate change solutions that protect, restore and sustainably manage nature and deliver strong outcomes for poverty reduction.\n",
      "The Blue Planet Fund supports programming in ODA-eligible coastal countries across the following 6 priority regions:\n",
      "South and Southeast Asia\n",
      "West Africa\n",
      "East Africa\n",
      "Latin America\n",
      "Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS)\n",
      "Pacific SIDS\n",
      "Our objectives\n",
      "Through a portfolio of bilateral and multilateral programmes, the Blue Planet Fund works across the 4 integrated themes: biodiversity, climate change, marine pollution and sustainable seafood.\n",
      "The Blue Planet Fund’s objectives are in line with the UK’s focus on protecting nature and tackling climate change through an integrated approach. Alongside its 4 overarching themes, programmes also incorporate cross-cutting themes such as gender and vulnerable groups, human rights and modern slavery, rule of law and corruption, nature based solutions, and economic shocks.\n",
      "Across its thematic areas, the Blue Planet Fund has 7 outcomes it aims to support through its programming. These are detailed below.\n",
      "Marine protected areas (MPAs) and Other Effective Conservation Measures (OECMs)\n",
      "Countries have increased willingness, capacity, and access to sustainable finance to establish and sustainably, effectively, and inclusively implement and manage MPAs and OECMs within national and international waters.\n",
      "Illegal Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) fishing\n",
      "IUU fishing activities are more effectively monitored, prevented, and deterred and international enablers of IUU are increasingly minimised.\n",
      "International and large-scale fisheries\n",
      "Management of regional and national fisheries and aquaculture is strengthened to deliver sustainable fish stocks and healthy marine ecosystems provide inclusive livelihoods, and reduce overfishing, including by removing or repurposing environmentally harmful subsidies.\n",
      "Solid waste and other forms of marine pollution\n",
      "Waste management systems are strengthened and move towards circular economy approaches that reduce solid waste and other forms of pollution – including ghost gear – entering the marine environment, while supporting inclusive poverty reduction and women’s empowerment.\n",
      "Small scale fisheries management\n",
      "Local communities have improved fisheries management knowledge, capacities and incentives, supporting more climate resilient, inclusive and sustainable livelihoods.\n",
      "Critical marine habitats for coastal resilience\n",
      "Locally inclusive approaches that protect, sustainably manage and restore marine ecosystems are demonstrated, scaled, and financed with private sector support, leading to improved biodiversity, ecosystem services and climate resilience of coastal communities.\n",
      "Aquaculture\n",
      "Sustainable, inclusive aquaculture approaches that help restore and avoid harm to the environment are demonstrated and increasingly adopted with private sector support.\n",
      "Our bilateral programmes\n",
      "The following is a summary of the Blue Planet Fund’s flagship bilateral programmes.\n",
      "Ocean Country Partnership Programme (OCPP)\n",
      "The OCPP supports countries to manage their marine environments more sustainably by:\n",
      "strengthening marine science, data and technological expertise\n",
      "developing science-based policy and management tools\n",
      "creating educational resources for coastal communities\n",
      "Through the OCPP, the UK will partner with up to 11 ODA-eligible countries to positively impact the coastal communities that depend on healthy marine ecosystems most. It will also support international initiatives and pilot projects that align with its aims.\n",
      "Read more about the OCPP.\n",
      "Ocean Community Empowerment and Nature (OCEAN)\n",
      "OCEAN is a new competitive grants programme to support local in-country projects that aim to deliver lasting change to the marine environment and coastal communities.\n",
      "Organisations including Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) will be able to submit applications for funding to deliver projects in ODA eligible countries, with the first call for proposals due to open in early 2024.  There will be two pots of funding available to bid for, with a smaller pot of up to £250,000 being targeted for small scale, local, in-country organisations and a larger one of up to £3 million to support organisations that can fund large-scale activities and scale up effective solutions.\n",
      "Read more about OCEAN.\n",
      "Climate and Ocean Adaptation and Sustainable Transition (COAST)\n",
      "The COAST programme has £154 million in funding from the Blue Planet Fund and will run from 2023 to 2030. COAST aims to improve the adaptive capacities, climate resilience and prosperity of vulnerable coastal communities in developing countries. It will support them with the sustainable management of their marine environment and coastal resources.\n",
      "COAST will focus on key themes underpinning its aim, including:\n",
      "coastal nature-based solutions\n",
      "small-scale fisheries management\n",

      "Asia-Africa BlueTech Superhighway, delivered by WorldFish\n",
      "Blue Carbon Action Partnership, delivered by the World Economic Forum\n",
      "A substantial third component will be procured for in due course, which will provide capacity, technical support, and grants for local level action around COAST’s themes.\n",
      "Sustainable Blue Economies (SBE)\n",
      "The £36 million SBE programme will run from 2023 to 2028, and aims to enhance the climate and economic resilience of ODA-eligible SIDS around the world. SIDS steward disproportionately large ocean territories that are home to unique biodiversity. The programme will tackle resource, capacity, and knowledge gaps in-country. It will support SIDS to design and implement blue economy plans, policies and interventions using sound scientific knowledge and data.\n",
      "Overall, SBE aims to:\n",
      "strengthen ocean management capacity\n",
      "improve livelihoods\n",
      "increase adaptive capacity\n",
      "The programme will achieve this through different methods, including:\n",
      "technical capacity development\n",
      "nature-based solutions\n",
      "nature-positive economic diversification\n",
      "Our multilateral programmes\n",

      "DFQC’s aim is to provide affordable quota leasing to vessels providing economic benefit to the Cornish economy. The DFQC quotas are held and managed by the Cornish Fish Producers Organisation (CFPO) according to strict guidelines set down by the Duchy Fish Quota Company board of directors. DFQC operate a fair and transparent system to ensure every fisher is treated equitably. In this trial, the DFQC (with support from Cornwall Council) will manage the financial aspects of the scheme \n",
      "CFPO \n",
      "CFPO Ltd is a recognised Producer Organisation for the purposes of quota management within the UK system, whilst the Duchy Fish Quota Company Ltd is not. Although the CFPO and DFQC are separate entities, the CFPO holds the fixed quota allocation (FQA) units owned by the DFQC on one of its dummy licenses (no 9024 on FQA register). The annual quota derived from these FQA units is managed by the CFPO on behalf of the DFQC, which includes quota leases/swaps within the CFPO and also possible external quota leases/swaps with boats in other producer organisations (POs) as well as with vessels in the non-sector and under 10m sector. Any additional quota received as part of the trial is ringfenced within the CFPO quota management database for the purposes of the Cornwall FMT scheme.  \n",

One of its objectives is to create “a thriving and sustainable Cornwall that offers a secure home, a decent income and a great environment for all” and its support of this pilot project is designed to help the fishing industry to contribute to this objective. \n",
      "At operational level Cornwall Council has worked with the CFPO and the DFQC on the development of the project and has utilised its experience of dealing with various grant schemes to design and develop the scoring system that will be used to assess applications for the additional quota.  Through its involvement in the scoring panel and the decision-making process it will bring independence into the decision-making process to ensure that all applications for additional quota are treated equally irrespective of whether they are from a CFPO member or a non CFPO member.   This will ensure that a fair and transparent scoring system is applied. \n",

      "The scoring system is included as Annex A.  \n",
      "Quota management process \n",
      "Quota is held by the MMO and allocated to each vessel as instructed by the group. Only named individuals included in the management document or other delegated named individuals agreed in writing may instruct the MMO on the allocation of quota to vessels.  \n",
      "The process for quota allocation depends on whether the vessel is part of the sector or non-sector. \n",
      "All vessels \n",
      "Quota assigned for the trial will be visible on the MMO’s Weekly Uptake Spreadsheets on a separate line.  \n",
      "Landings will appear against the individual vessel’s PO/Group, with quota moved from the trial line to cover this activity within the agreed limits.  \n",
      "Participating vessels should report their landings directly to the trial group administrator. This includes both sector and non-sector participants.  The MMO will also monitor uptake. \n",
      "Sector vessels \n",
      "Sector vessels participating in the trial will have their landings attributed to their PO for quota management purposes.  \n",
      "The landings (up to the agreed limits for relevant stocks) will then be covered by transferring quota from the trial line to the PO line via a domestic quota swap.  \n",
      "When it has been confirmed that a vessel has landed quota against the trial, the relevant PO should submit a domestic swap form to the domestic quota swap inbox QuotaSwap.DQS@marinemanagement.org.uk stating either group 1 or 2 as the ‘Cornish Community Quota Trial’ (Signed by CFPO/DFQC), transferring the quota to their PO. \n",
      "The MMO Quota team will process the swap as a normal domestic swap, moving quota from the trial line to the relevant PO quota line.  \n",
      "All landings by the vessel will be counted against the individual’s PO uptake, including any above allocated trial quota. \n",
      "Non-sector vessels \n",
      "Non-Sector participants will be assigned quota before they land against it.  \n",
      "This will be done using the existing quota lease system. However, rather than the quota coming from the PO it will come from the trial line. \n",
      "To enable this, the group will submit a domestic swap form to the domestic quota swap inbox QuotaSwap.DQS@marinemanagement.org.uk stating either group 1 ‘10m and under Lease’ or ‘Non-Sector Lease’, or group 2 ‘Cornish Community Quota Trial’. The form will be signed by a representative from the Cornish group. The vessel details should be included in the comments box.  \n",
      "The MMO Quota team will process the swap as a normal domestic swap, moving quota from the trial line to the relevant quota leasing line. They will also issue a leasing letter via email to the licence holder and Port Office. \n",
      "The monitoring and enforcement will be the same as with any quota lease, with activity recorded against the monthly catch limit until reached and then against the trial quota amounts agreed and listed in the leasing letter. \n",
      "If a vessel overfishes both monthly catch limit and the additional quota assigned through the trial, it will be investigated by MMO enforcement. \n",
      "The trial group should establish a reporting system by non-sector vessels as a condition of lease.  Non-sector vessels should report uptake directly to the trial group administrator. \n",
      "2.4Monitoring of uptake \n",
      "The group will monitor uptake and other parameters across all participating vessels. In reality the only data the group will have immediate access to is from vessels within CFPO, so reporting of landings and other parameters will take place through agreements with participating vessels’ POs or directly with non-sector participants. Monitoring of landings by other vessels for regulatory purposes will be the responsibility of either the MMO for under 10m or non-sector vessels, or other POs for over 10m Sector vessels. Reporting enables the group to have oversight of outcomes and monitor against objectives.  \n",
      "Uptake of quota allocated through the scheme will be monitored by the group on a monthly basis. If any do not fish their allocated quota the management of the trial will communicate with the individual and understand any additional barriers or issues they are encountering and seek ways to support them. If no progress is made, then the management of the trial will aim to redistribute the quota and make it available to others in the scheme using the same scoring process before any allocation is made.  \n",
      "Overfishes may occur by accident or may be intentional. Overfishes are not the responsibility of the group to manage. Any overfish event will be investigated by the group and action taken to remove the participant from the scheme if there is good reason to suspect an overfish was intentional, however the individual’s PO or non-sector quota managers remain responsible for dealing with overfish events. \n",
      "Vessels within CFPO \n",
      "Within the CFPO, catch limits are managed on a monthly basis. Any additional quota from the scheme would be added to a vessel’s monthly quota allocation and uptake monitored until the additional quota has been fully utilised.  \n",
      "Within CFPO, individual landings made by vessels are monitored and CFPO can notify members when they are close to quota limits. If there is an overfish then CFPO will follow their standard process is to redistribute quota within the CFPO where possible, as well as following a rule book process with the member.  \n",
      "Vessels from other POs \n",
      "The vessel’s PO monitors uptake by the individual vessel and reports to the Cornish Group for trial monitoring purposes. An agreement including reporting schedule and details will be reached as part of the lease agreement.  \n",
      "Any overfish is the responsibility of the PO to rectify. The participating vessel’s PO has systems in place to monitor landings and overfishes.  \n",
      "Non-sector vessels \n",
      "The monitoring of landings by vessels in the non-sector pools for regulatory purposes remains with the MMO, however given data sharing complexities, an additional agreement between participating vessels and the group is required and reporting should take place directly between participating non-sector vessels and the group. This ensures the group can monitor uptake and outcomes of the trial measures.   \n",
      "Landings including overfishes by any under 10m and non-sector boats are subject to monitoring and enforcement by the MMO.  \n",
      "Additional monitoring \n",
      "In order to manage non-CFPO members the trial will set up a working group with an MMO quota team member of staff and Defra representative as appropriate. Quarterly meetings allow data sharing to ensure any additional quote via the trial is managed in accordance with agreements and enables changes to be discussed where required.  \n",
      "Separate meetings will be arranged between the group and any business that takes part in the trial to monitor other impacts and outcomes from this work, such as training and marketing.  \n",
      "Quota exchanges \n",
      "Both domestic and international swaps may be required to maximise the benefits of this trial.  \n",
      "Swapping enables the group to be flexible, both in relation to environmental factors and to fishers’ demands for particular stocks. Enabling use of the domestic and international mechanism reduces the risk of underfishes in some stocks, as predictions of stocks of interest to fishers in Cornwall has been made in advance of the trial commencing.  \n",
      "This trial scheme is not dependent upon having access to specific stocks, rather it relies on having any quota that is desirable to fishers in Cornwall. As desirable quota may change depending on various factors, enabling flexibility assists the trial in achieving its objectives. \n",
      "Swaps will be put forward and completed by the MMO, following the package being arranged in principle by the group. Additional restrictions on use of the mechanism may be necessary and swaps using trial quota will be published by the MMO alongside non-sector swaps to increase transparency. \n",
      "Quota changes \n",
      "Future requirements for quota will take into account variables affecting supply and demand including total allowable catch (TAC) changes. Agreement will be reached before the start of the subsequent fishing year. \n",

This document identifies the recruitment and retention of people as a key pillar and ensures the industry attracts, develops, and retains crews and onshore workers across the supply chain. Therefore, this project can target support and funds towards retaining and developing the current catch sector workforce, which in turn will deliver the following: \n",
      "Plug a skills and qualification gap  \n",
      "Improve career progression and retention in the industry \n",
      "Broadening the talent pool of individuals operating within the catching sector of the Cornish fishing industry  \n",
      "Funds generated by this pilot will be used to address this part of the strategy. Funds will be used to support individuals seeking to take higher level qualifications, such as a Class 2 skipper’s ticket. The course runs for 12 weeks and is comprised of the following: \n",
      "The Class 2 qualification will also improve the safety of the vessels and crew working onboard, as higher-level qualifications will build experience and safe working. The qualification consists of the following: \n",
      "002-61 – Navigation \n",
      "002-62 – Chartwork and Pilotage \n",
      "002-63 – Meteorology \n",

      "Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) Signals \n",
      "Seafish currently cover the course costs, but one of the other major barriers is the ability for an individual to not earn for 12 weeks. Therefore, the group propose that funds will be targeted to cover lost earnings, travel, accommodation, and subsistence, as the ability for an individual to take 12 weeks away from earning at sea will remain the main barrier to building the future qualified workforce within the fishing industry.  \n",
      "To add to the recruitment and retention challenges the industry is facing, the MCA are also introducing stricter regulations to improve the health and safety of the catching sector. This is both targeted at the safety and stability of fishing vessels and focuses on the skills and qualifications of those working onboard with increased requirements for higher level qualifications onboard fishing vessels. With the increased demands from the MCA, the industry needs to build a higher qualified workforce, which this project sets out to do.  \n",
      "Further to this, the average age of the current workforce is late 50s (Fishing for a Future report - Seafarers Charity). Although this age group brings a lot of experience, there is a real shortage of younger people entering the industry and those obtaining higher-level qualifications. If this issue is not addressed, then the risk is that in 5-10 years’ time there will be a total shortage of qualified skippers (Cornish Fish Producers’ Organisation Fishing Strategy, 2021). If there are not enough qualified skippers for the current vessels, this will have major knock-on effects on the industry, as without boats going to sea, it quickly ricochets down the supply chain.  \n",
      "The development of this project and the subsequent monitoring and evaluation can create valuable knowledge relevant to ports across the UK, with suggestions and learnings about how the industry can plug the skills gap nationally.  \n",
      "Marketing \n",
      "The focus will be to support recruitment and retention of people and encourage career progression.  \n",

      "Pursue selected options accordingly\n",
      "In the case of an alleged overshoot breach that remains unresolved the member will be issued a notice in writing of the breach\n",
